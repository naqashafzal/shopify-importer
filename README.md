Shopify to WooCommerce Importer: The Ultimate Migration Tool

Seamlessly migrate your products from Shopify to WooCommerce with the most powerful and user-friendly importer plugin for WordPress. Designed for store owners and developers, this tool gives you complete control over your product data, ensuring a smooth and accurate transition.

Tired of complex CSV files and incomplete migration tools? The Shopify to WooCommerce Importer connects directly to your Shopify store via its secure API, allowing you to fetch, select, and import your products in just a few clicks, all without ever leaving your WordPress dashboard.
Key Features

Our importer is packed with professional-grade features designed to save you time and prevent common migration headaches.

    One-Click Product Fetching: Securely connect your Shopify store and fetch your entire product catalog with a single click.

    Selective Import Control: Don't want to import everything? Our intuitive interface displays all your Shopify products in a clean, searchable list. Use checkboxes to select exactly which items you want to migrate.

    Live Search & Pagination: Instantly filter your product list by name. For large stores, a simple pagination system makes it easy to navigate through your entire inventory.

    "Select All Filtered" Functionality: Quickly select hundreds of products that match your search criteria, even across multiple pages, with our powerful "Select All" feature.

    Comprehensive Data Mapping: We ensure your product data arrives intact and correctly organized:

        Shopify Collections → WooCommerce Categories: Your carefully curated collections are automatically created as product categories.

        Shopify Tags → WooCommerce Tags: All product tags are preserved and assigned correctly.

        Shopify Vendor → WooCommerce "Brand" Attribute: A "Brand" attribute is automatically created and populated with your Shopify vendor information.

    Full Product Type Support: The plugin intelligently detects and handles both Simple and Variable Products, ensuring all your product variations (like size or color) are imported perfectly.

    Robust AJAX-Powered Import: The import process runs in the background using AJAX. This prevents server timeouts on large imports and provides real-time feedback.

    Live Progress Bar & Log: Watch the import happen in real-time! A progress bar shows the overall status, while a detailed log lists each product as it's imported, confirming which categories were assigned or noting if a product was skipped.

    Secure Credential Management: Your Shopify API keys are stored securely in your WordPress database, so you only need to enter them once.

    Built-in User Guide & Support: The plugin includes a handy "How to Use" guide right in the sidebar, and a simple way to support the author for future development.

How It Works: A Simple 3-Step Process

Migrating your store has never been easier.

Step 1: Connect Your Store
After a one-time verification, go to the plugin's settings page. Get your API credentials from your Shopify admin by creating a Custom App with read_products permission. Paste the keys into the settings and click "Save".

Step 2: Fetch and Select Your Products
Click the "Fetch Available Products" button. Your entire Shopify catalog will appear in a searchable and paginated list. Use the checkboxes to select the products you want to import.

Step 3: Run the Import
Click "Import Selected Products" and watch as the plugin works its magic. The progress bar will advance, and the log will update in real-time, giving you complete visibility into the process. Once complete, your selected products will be live in your WooCommerce store, complete with their categories, tags, and brand information.
